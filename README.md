# calculator

This calculator contains functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

This project is a showcase of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Specifically, DOM manipulation and storing user-entered values to call on functions will be put to test in this project.
